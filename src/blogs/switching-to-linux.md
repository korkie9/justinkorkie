### Switching to Linux (never going back)

I, like many other devs in the world, particularly in South Africa it seems, started my journey with Windows. It was cheap, didn't charge hidden costs and it was good for gaming.

That was of course until I got a job and was afforded a Mac. Close friends know I am by no means an Apple fanboy but I'd be lying if I didn't say Mac was the superior product in every way. The machine managed only 8gb of RAM but that RAM did what it needed to do. 

True to Apple's form it only held 256+gb of storage so you would really have to make it count. Occasionally I would find myself baffled by certain apps (like Android Studio) not working and so would have to use a clean up app to clear any unused storage now and again. Until then you'd have an irritating box that reminded you about this. I eventually accepted my fate and made friends with this box. His name was Eddie. A part of me still misses him.

It wouldn't be till about 2 years later when I would start using a far more superior system that came with its own gems and traps. I didn't really choose the Linux life. I was kind of forced to use it. I have a PC at the time of writing this. It has 8gb ram and a 4ghz processor, hardly a gaming laptop. As a dev I need multiple processes running simultaneously. I simply could not afford the agonising speed my system ran at every time I opened a browser, let alone a text editor or IDE. I heard Linux was pretty fast and so I figured it was worth a try

My first distro after long consideration and as advised by a friend was Pop_Os. I understood it was good for beginners. I was already very familiar with the terminal which is I guess what makes people claim Linux is a difficult OS to use. It wasn't that bad and it ran like a beast. I was hooked. I could run all the process I needed and even create more virtual memory if the 8gb wasn't enough. I even decided to install Fedora on a smaller PC I had lying around. As for gaming Linux surprisingly (or unsurprisingly depending on who you ask) has a very rich ecosystem for gaming. Steam even has support for Linux so you can continue your 10,000 hours on CS Go and Dota 2.

I was having trouble installing mysql though which in hind sight was really just a small skill issue. I was also becoming interested in cyber security so I figured why not try Kali. I loved it. It even came with mysql preinstalled. One small issue I take with rolling releases though is that it's so bleeding edge that now and again when you have an issue, there may not be great help but this is rare. One day I tried installing virtual box and ended up deleting my desktop environment. My laptop couldn't connect to the internet which I would find out was a hardware issue. I figured it was time to move. 

I had toyed with the idea of Arch before but I was ready for a humbler OS. One that just worked. At the time of writing this I am using Linux Mint with the XFCE desktop. I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to play around with Linux as a casual or work OS.

That being said, Linux is the üêê
